# Gilles Castel's Latex Snippets Ported to Luasnip

An attempt at porting the snippets that Gilles Castel (https://github.com/gillescastel/) had in his [latex-snippets](https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets) repository in [Luasnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) lua syntax. I could not port all of his snippets, due to a lack of experience with Ultisnips and Luasnips at my part.

## The Purpose of This Branch of this Repository
This branch of this repository is meant to have snippets written in Luasnip that contain the *exact same functionality* that his snippets written in Ultisnips syntax had. 

Personally, when porting these snippets, I felt that a) Castel may have made some mistakes when writing these snippets, i.e. that some of these snippets were redundant, and b) that I had some ideas that could improve upon his snippets, i.e. adding conditions to prevent some snippets from triggering outside of math environments. Despite this, I didn't want to litter this with my own ideas--whose motivations are subjective--so I decided to port all of the snippets exactly as they were. I want this branch of this repository to provide a base for anyone inspired by Castel's snippets to take his exact snippets with their exact purpose, only now in Luasnip syntax, and change them for themselves as they see fit.
